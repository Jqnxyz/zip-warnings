# The `.zip` TLD sucks

This domain was not a mistake.

Google has chosen to [launch new top-level domains](https://www.blog.google/products/registry/8-new-top-level-domains-for-dads-grads-tech/) which includes the `.zip` and `.mov` TLDs. This is a terrible idea.

When you see a `.zip` or `.mov` link, you expect to download a file. But with the new TLDs, you might be downloading a file, or you might be visiting a website. You can't tell at first glance and the less tech-savvy users will likely be confused.

The existence of these TLDs do not make sense, and they do not add any value. These TLDs are frivolous and have no obvious purpose as compared to other TLDs like `.dev` or `.wiki`.
